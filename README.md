# vscode - A C, C++, Java Learning Environment

This is a repository of a file tree that I use on Redhat Linux for my own learning.

I'm sharing it here for anyone's reference or forking.

Most of the example code descends from <a href="https://tutorialspoint.com">TutorialsPoint.com</a>.

However, at times, I've changed class names, file names, or even format to suit my own needs.  In addition, I've added comments at various points to help describe what is happening in the code or provide reminders for myself.

This is a work in progress.  Additions will be normal.  As always, use at your own risk.
